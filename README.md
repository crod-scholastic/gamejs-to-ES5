# Game.0.1.js to ES5 template

## Run
1. Clone repository
2. Run `npm install` (to download babel)
3. Place your `game.0.1.js` file (must be named that for now) in the project root
1. Run `npm run build` 
5. Check `./dist/` and the outputted ES5 code should be there. Copy / paste that into our regular workflow.
